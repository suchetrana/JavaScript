that is passed as an argument to another function.
This "outer" function then calls the callback function
at a later point to perform a specific task.

Splice()

Syntax:
array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...);

The slice() method is a JavaScript array function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object.

Crucially, slice() does not modify the original array.
It creates and returns a new one. This makes it a non-mutating (or immutable) method.
array.slice(start, end);
